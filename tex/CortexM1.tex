\section{Cortex M1 / M3}

Description of the setup of Cortex M1 and Cortex M3 Cores. \cite{arm_arm_2018} \cite{arm_cortex-m1_nodate}

\subsection{Usage of the Keil Toolchain}

Link to tutorial enough? Maybe most basic steps (e.g. adaption of arty project for our needs). \cite{noauthor_getting_nodate}

\subsection{Usage of Cortex M1 in Vivado}

Only global implementation / synthesis runs are permitted to obtain a working bitstream.
If OOC (Out of Context) runs are used, everything except for the Cortex M1 will work fine. 
The Cortex M1 will enter a hard-fault state which does not allow recovery. 
This is indicated by a high bit on the \textit{Lockup} port of the processor.

Also trivial, follow tutorial that is provided on ARM Website and adapt to own needs.

\subsubsection{Code via Memory Initialization File}

File is bound to synthesis process, how to change it...

\subsection{How to mbed OS}

How was the Cortex M1 Project adapted to support the Mbed OS?
What is gained through the usage of mbed OS?

\subsection{Implemented Functionality on the Cortex M1}

How are the UART and IIC peripherals supported in the source code, which libraries are used, interrupt based or not, performance?

Show highlights of the code?
