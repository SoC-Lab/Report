In this lab, fail-safe mechanisms for \glspl{ECU} are explored on the basis of \gls{PR} in \glspl{FPGA}.
The introduced design contains typical characteristics of an automotive system.
Communication between the different sub-systems is realized by a specific link (including protocol) and connects the \gls{FPGA} to the \glspl{ECU} that handle operations during normal conditions. 
\glspl{ECU} are monitored by a bus monitor in the \gls{FPGA} for nominal operation characteristics and can be replaced by the instantiation of the very same \gls{ECU} within the \gls{FPGA} in case of failure.
