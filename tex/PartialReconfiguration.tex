\section{Partial Reconfiguration}
This section reasons about design choices and encountered obstacles during the development process.

\subsection{Limitations imposed by partial reconfiguration}
\gls{PR} does impose some limitations on the design process, a brief description of the encountered limitations and how they were handled is given in the following.

\subsubsection{No block diagram support}
\subsubsection{PCAP / ICAP on the Zynq-7000}
\subsubsection{ICAP primitive instantiation}

What is partially reconfigured - Cortex, uart, IIC.

Why not use AXI?

\subsection{Integration Overview}
\cite{xilinx_vivado_2018-1}, \cite{xilinx_vivado_2018}
Usage of \gls{ICAP}.

How is the Zynq still used - Loading images and binary blobs from sd card into DDR.

\subsection{Packaged IP}
Why is the PR IP Packaged, how was it done? \cite{xilinx_ug1118-vivado-creating-packaging-custom-ip.pdf_nodate}
